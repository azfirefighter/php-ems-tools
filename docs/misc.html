<p><b>index.html</b> - The index.html file in the PHP EMS Tools directory is
the master index to all components. This provides links to all of the major
components on a simple, easy-to-use page.</p>

<p><b>Monthly Hour Totals</b> - This simple script iterates through all of the
members in the roster, and counts the number of hours each member was on duty
this month, displaying them in a table as Days, Nights, and Total. At the moment, the only way to change month and year is to change
them in the URL (months as two-digit numbers from 01-12) but a form to select
month and year should be coming soon.</p>

<p><b>Yearly Hour Totals</b> - This script simply makes a table like Monthly
Totals, but has a column for the overall total for each month of the year, and
a column for the yearly total.</p>

<p><b>Main (index.php) Page - Site-Specific Links - </b>PHP EMS Tools allows
you to include custom links on the main page. These are stored in the
localLinks.php file, and automatically included in the main page. The syntax
is HTML within a PHP echo statement, and examples are given.</p>
