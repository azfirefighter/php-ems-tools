<b>Rights Level - </b>The rights level field dictates how much a user can do,
when authenticated with a ID and password. The possible values are 0, 1,
2. When the package checks for rights levels, it uses an evaluation with the
algebraic greater than operator, therefore any given rights level has all of
the rights of the lower levels.</p>
<p><b>0</b> - the lowest, standard user rights. These users have access to all
normal user functions (i.e. signing on the schedule) but NO administrative
privilages.</p>
<p><b>1</b> - Standard administrator/officer rights. This includes
adding/editing/removing members from the roster and changing schedule entries
that occurred in the past.</p>
<p><b>2</b> - This is the "super-user" rights level. It is analagous to root
access, and allows the user to make changes above and beyond the
officers/administrators. I recommend that only the one person in charge of
maintaining the system use this level, and furthermore that you create a
special account for these tasks, using a longer-than-usual ID and a secure
password. <b>NOTE: There are, as of the currently released version, no
festures which require use of this level. However, I would recommend giving it
to your own ID for future use.</b> <i>Note:</i> for security reasons, this
level cannot be assigned through php-ems-tools. You must modify the MySQL
database directly to use it. In order to do this, get a command prompt on the
server running MySQL, on an account with rights to modify the table. Now,
issue the following commands in MySQL (client): <code>USE roster;</code> then
<code>UPDATE ROSTER SET rightsLevel=2 WHERE EMTid="myID";</code> where myID is
the ID of the account you want to change, in quotes.
</p>
<p><i>Another note on rights levels: </i>the administrators, obviously, can
change rightsLevels through the web-based roster edit tool. There are a few
things to remember with this:
<ul>
<li>People who lose their positions as administrators or officers should have
their rightsLevel brought back down to 0 (user).</li>
<li>Your administrators should NOT assign a higher rightsLevel to an
unauthorized user as a convenience. This is only asking for trouble.</li>
<li>It IS possible for an administrator to change their own rightsLevel back
to 0, thereby requiring intervention from another administrator to restore
it. All administrators should be careful when editing the roster entries of
other administrators.</li></p>
<p><i>Removing a member:</i> In order to keep records accurate, it's best not
to remove members mid-year. It is suggested that to remove a member, you
should set their membership status to 'Resigned' in the Edit form. To
permanently remove a member, you must remove them manually from the MySQL database.</p>
