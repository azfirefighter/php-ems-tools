CHANGELOG
------------------------------------------------------------

Release 4.1 - 2009-01-??
- Changed committees to be in the database  - added 'committees',
'committee_positions' and 'member_committees'. Added committees.php and
modified rosterPositions.php.
- Added docs/schema_notes.txt to keep track of the DB schema.


Release 4.0 - ???DATE???
- MAJOR RELEASE - this is not compatible with previous versions as the table
structure has changed and config files have changed. If you wish to upgrade,
please contact the developer for a migration script.
- Major overhaul of the scheduling system to move everything to one table,
based on unix timestamps, and scheduling in half-hour increments.
- Also majoe overwrite of schedule.php and associated forms (signon, etc.) to
make it Ajax-y (DHTML) and colorful.

Release 3.0 - ???DATE???
- MAJOR RELEASE - this is not compatible with previous versions as the table
structure has changed and config files have changed. If you wish to upgrade,
please contact the developer for a migration script.
- Added code to allow rig names and check data to be defined by user. Moved
this information to rigCheckData.php and added a require_once for this file in
custom.php. 
- Added rigCheckHandler.php to handle selection of different rigs and take the
user to the right page
- Changed link in index.php to point to rigCheckHandler.php
- Changed rigCheck.php and blankRigCheck.php to use a URL variable for the rig
number
- Moved all site-specific configuration to config/ directory. Kept custom.php
in place for reverse-compatibility. For old versions, move your existing
custom.php to config/config.php and then just bring everything else in and
change as needed.
- Change *all* includes which pointed to custom.php to now point to config/config.php
- Corrected stylesheet links in most of the roster pages, they had been
pointing to a deprecated "style.css", all should point to "php_ems.css".
- moved some files to the admin/ directory to clean things up - files were
checkMD5.php, makeMD5.php, makeShowAs.php
- moved some files to the inc/ directory to clean things up - files were
global.php, notify.php, antman.php
- Added columns to roster table in database - OtherPositions and OtherCerts -
both TEXT.
