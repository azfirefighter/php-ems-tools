<b>A FEW NOTES ON SECURITY:</b></p>
<p>
The passwords used in this package are weak. They are stored in the database
both as an MD5 sum and as CLEAR TEXT. A user with rudimentary knowledge of
Unix, MySQL, PHP, or any relevant programming language could gain access to
them. Any user with access to the server on which PHP EMS Tools is hosted can
view the passwords, if they have MySQL permissions. Furthermore, with
Anonymous access, most any user who understands MySQL can access them. You
should be sure that Anonymous access is granted for users @localhost ONLY, and
that ALL users with accounts on the machine have specific permissions assigned
in MySQL, or they will be able to have FULL access to the database.
</p><p>
That being said, these passwords are NOT intended for true security, or for
tracking which users performed what actions. They are simply intended as a way
to stop CASUAL users from making changes to the schedule, roster, etc.
</p><p>
I HIGHLY recommend that if you are worried about data integrity, you upgrade
to a better authentication scheme.
</p><p>
<b>The authentication in PHP EMS Tools is intended for LOCAL networks ONLY,
not externally-visible machines.</b> If you are intending on serving these
documents to the internet (i.e. NOT just on the LAN inside your building), you MUST upgrade the
authentication scheme. In this case, I would recommend sessions and/or HTTPS
authentication. Furthermore, if at all possible, I would recommend creating a
seperate directory or seperate files for access from the outside world, which
cannot be used to make any changes. This seperate directory, with a view-only
schedule, should be included in one of the next releases.
</p><p>
The setup of the MySQL server for php-ems-tools requires Anonymous access. It
is IMPERATIVE that if you setup the php-ems-tools server so that it is
accessible from the outside world, you have ONLY the web server port open. You
MUST block access to the MySQL port.
</p><p>
A NOTE ON THE .HTACCESS:
</p><p>
That being said, I have decided that my builtin authentication is the best
method. If you consider doing Apache Auth (in httpd.conf or .htaccess) please
BE AWARE that this WILL save a password on the computer being used to access
the site. It WILL NOT allow multiple people do use multiple
usernames/passwords in a short span of time.
