=== Schedule URL variables and time-telling
+++ *Everything* should go by timestamps. This eliminates the need for knowing
anything about day/night.
+ The schedule itself should just calculate based on a timstamp incrementing.
+ SignOn should get sched_year, sched_month, sched_date, sched_shift, and
sched_date_ts where the final of that list is the starting ts of the shift.
+ Edit and Remove should only get the signon_ID
