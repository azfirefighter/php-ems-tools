<h1>Changes in new call report (PCR) program</h1>

<ul>
<li>Patient information (name, DOB, address) is stored separately from the
call report. This allows quicker call entry (just search for a name or
address) and also allows us to keep statistics on how often our patients are
transported. To input patient information, click on "Find Patient" and first
search for a patient. It's probably best to just enter the first few letters
of their last name, or the street they live on. If you don't get any results,
click on "Add New Patient" and enter the information. The patients from the
past few years have already been added, if they had complete information.</li>
<li>
Call Locations are stored separately as well, and in a structured
format. Click on the "Call Location" box, you can search for previous
locations (i.e. type in Parisis and it will come back with the right address)
or enter a new one as either a street address or an intersection.
</li>
<li>
By default, only one row of vitals is shown. Click "Add another set of vitals"
to add more rows as needed.
</li>
<li>
By default, three crew members are shown. Click "Add Crew Member" to add crew
members as needed.
</li>
<li>
You now only need to enter each member's ID once. Just check the boxes for who
was the driver.
</li>
<li>
In the crew area, BEFORE YOU ENTER ANYONE'S NUMBER, click on "Get Duty
Crew". The duty crew at the time of dispatch will automatically be filled in.
</li>
<li>
Crew member Duty/General status is stored with the call report at the time it
was submitted. Whether the call was a Duty or General call is automatically calculated.
</li>
</ul>
