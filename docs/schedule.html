schedule.php
</p>
<p>
The schedule layout is fairly straightforward. It displays a monthly schedule,
showing all of the days in a given month with six slots per day. In
custom.php, you can restrict sign-ons for shifts previous to the current one
(allowing only administrators to change events in the past) as well as
optionally requiring a password or administrator for sign-ons, removals, or
changes. The "<< Month" link goes to the previous month's schedule, and the "
Month >>" link goes to the next month. The "HELP" link opens a JavaScript
Pop-Up with some simple instructions and explanations. When viewing the Night
schedule, the "Days" link shows the day schedule for the current month. The
"Nights" link on the Days schedule works likewise. The "Count Hours" link goes
directly to the Count Monthly Hours page for the month being viewed. The
"Current Shift" link goes to the current shift (by month and time of day).</p>

<p>If the current date is the 15th of the month or later, the schedule
automatically scrolls down to the lower half of the page, if the current month
is being viewed.</p>

<p>The schedule page automatically refreshes itself every time a change is
made by the computer that is viewing it. It also refreshes itself every 180
seconds (3 minutes) to update changes that may have been made on different
computers.</p>

<p>To sign a member on, simply click in an empty slot (dashed box) in the
desired day of the desired month/shift. This will open a JavaScript window to
sign on. If the settings in custom.php dictate it, an ID and password may need
to be entered. The member can select the action to be taken (Sign On, Edit -
to change ID or times, or Remove), type in their ID, select the start and end
times (by default, set to the start and end of the shift), and click
Submit. The pop-up will submit the data, refresh the schedule window, and
close itself.</p>

<p>To set a message for a particular day (text to display next to the date),
click in the area next to the date. A similar pop-up will open, allowing the
administrator to enter their ID and password, and add/edit or remove a
message. It is recommended that this task be restricted to
administrators/officers, but this can be changed in custom.php</p>

<p><b>Email & text message alerts:</b><br>
The schedule has the option to send out email alerts and/or text messages (via
email) to the other members in a given shift to notify them of a member
signing on, editing their times, or signing off. These options are set in the
custom.php file. Currently, the only way to disable alerts for a specific
member is to remove their email or textEmail address from the roster.
