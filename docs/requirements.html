<b>Package Dependencies:</b>
<p>
PHP EMS Tools requires that the following packages be installed on the server
in order to function. The only way around this is to modify the code, which
requires some knowledge of PHP programming and will probably result in some
loss of functionality. WARNING - Please do not modify the code unless you know
what you are doing! Be aware that improper modification of a single CHARACTER
in the code could result in the program not running, or not behaving
correctly. ALSO - be aware that changes, whether major or minor, do not always
have easily visible effects. Moving a space, quote, or other character may
allow the program to run but will cause unintended errors.
</p><p>
These dependencies are for the SERVER only. The web interface can be used with
any modern web browser, provided that it supports JAVASCRIPT and the JS
support is enabled.
</p><p>
NOTE - Please read through these dependencies. I WILL ONLY SUPPORT the
configurations listed as "recommended". If you choose to use something else,
that is perfectly acceptable (perhaps superior for your purposes) but I will
not provide support related to alternate configurations, as the permutations
are infinite, and I would rather have in-depth knowledge about a few systems
rather than know bits about all of them.
</p><p>
A NOTE ON PORTABILITY/PLATFORM-INDEPENDENCE - PHP-EMS-Tools is coded in PHP
and JavaScript, which are platform-independent languages. That being said, all
development was done on a LAMP (Linux/MySQL/Apache/PHP) platform. While it
*should* run with *minor* modifications on any platform that supports the
requirements, it is HIGHLY recommended that a Linux- or Unix-based server be used.
</p><p>
A NOTE ON COST - If you have gotten this far into the documentation, you
probably have some knowledge about *nix systems. If not, I understand that
there's a steep learning curve, and will do my best to help you. Before we
proceed to the list, it should be noted that ALL of the dependencies can be
obtained free of charge, and most (if not all) are Open-Source Software. Thus,
it should not cost you ANYTHING (except time) to get this up and running.
</p><p>
i) *nix - Some of the commands implemented rely on the standard built-in
libraries of *nix (Unix/Linux) systems. These include date, awk, etc. They
should be found in most standard installations of these systems. Functionality
under Windows has not been tested, and is not recommended. 
</p><p>
ii) Web Server - Obviously, a web server is required. It must support
JavaScript and PHP, as well as Authentication. Apache2 is highly
recommended. Apache2 also supports authentication by MySQL, which is a plus
with the roster system.
</p><p>
iii) MySQL - PHP-EMS-Tools uses MySQL as its database server. This should be
installed locally on the server machine, along with its' command-line client
tools. Be sure that the user which the web server runs as has appropriate
(full) permissions to the databases.
</p><p>
iv) PHP5 - The heart of the package is PHP. It is written for PHP5. Be sure to have the COMPLETE
PHP package installed, with ay options that seem logical (such as
--with-mysql). If you do not know what this means, please review the PHP
documentation. For the email alerts to work, you must have the PHP mail()
function <i>working</i>. This means a proper configuration of your
sendmail/postfix or other MTA, and making sure that it works with PHP.
</p><p>
v) PEAR - The PEAR extensions package for PHP should be installed.
</p><p>
vi) Java - You may find it helpful to have Java and an appropriate compiler
installed on the server, for development use.
</p><p>
vii) LibChart - LibChart, a free, open-source (GPL) package is used to provide
all of the graphs for statistics. It must be installed to have these functions.
</p><p>
viii) GD - The statistics functions (graphing) provided by LibChart rely on
the GD library, as well as the JPEG, PNG, and ZLIB libraries. Be sure to have
the libraries and their includes installed.
</p><p>
ix) HTML_QuickForms - All of the form-based pages (which are required parts of
the package) are created using the PEAR package HTML_QuickForms. You must have
this installed on the server.
</p>
<p>
x) Broswer - The client browser must have JavaScript enabled. Also, as the
site utilizes pop-up windows, pop-up support should be enabled. Mozilla
Firefox is HIGHLY recommended over other browsers. Also please note that the
JavaScript popups will NOT work on a text browser such as lynx that doesn't
support Java.

<b>2) Development Platform Information:</b>
</p><p>
Development was conducted on the following platform: 
</p><p>
SuSE Linux 9.3 on an i586 platform<br>
Apache 2.0.53<br>
MySQL 4.1.10a<br>
PHP 4.3.10<br>
</p>

<hr>
<p>
3) Tested Platforms:<br>
</p><p>
As of this time, only the development platform above has been tested.
</p><p>
I have run it on a few machines, but all of them are configured more or less
the same.
</p><p>
*Minor* departures from the above configuration should not cause major issues.

A NOTE ON SOURCE CODE - Personally, I recommend that all of these dependencies
(PHP, Apache, MySQL, etc.) be compiled from source code. Their individual
documentation should include instructions for this. You can also find ample
HOWTO's on the installation procedure for, say, Apache + MySQL + PHP. When you
do this, please BE SURE to keep the source code in a directory on your
machine, as you may have to re-compile a few times to get all of the kinks
worked out. Keep these sources in a common, easy-to-remember location, such as
in directories in /usr/src
